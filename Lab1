Lab 1:
1. Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.
check already ok.

2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.
Fundamental reasons: The flexibility of on-demand resource allocation, the economy of reducing hardware and maintenance costs, and the convenience of supporting rapid scaling and innovation.
Pros: High resource utilization; Low initial investment cost; Facilitates remote access and collaboration.
Cons: Risks of data security and privacy leakage; Dependence on stable network connections; Potential high subscription costs for long-term use.

3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?
The primary function is to create and manage virtual machines, coordinate the allocation of physical hardware resources among multiple virtual machines, and ensure isolation between virtual 
machines and between virtual machines and the host system.

4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?
A virtual machine is a virtual computer system that simulates complete hardware functions through software. It can run on a physical computer, with its own operating system and applications, 
as if it were an independent physical machine.

5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?
Benefits include: Improving hardware resource utilization; Facilitating rapid deployment and testing of new systems or applications; Enabling parallel operation of different operating systems; 
Enhancing system security (through isolation); Simplifying backup, recovery, and migration processes.

6. List five use cases of virtual machines.
Software development and testing: Testing applications in different operating system environments.
Server consolidation: Integrating the functions of multiple physical servers into virtual machines on a few physical machines to reduce costs.
Data center virtualization: Improving resource utilization and management efficiency of data centers.
Education and training: Providing students with independent experimental environments with different configurations.
Running legacy applications: Running applications that only support old systems on modern operating systems through virtual machines.

7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system? b
a) The main operating system running on the physical machine
b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine
c) The operating system running on a remote server
d) The operating system running on a mobile device

8. What does virtual machine isolation mean? c
a) Virtual machines can communicate directly with the physical hardware.
b) Virtual machines share the same resources and cannot be isolated.
c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.
d) Virtual machines can only be accessed locally.
